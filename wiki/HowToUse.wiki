This page describes how to run simulations for multipath TCP

= Quick Start =

  === Using sample script ===
  You can download the sample script from http://code.google.com/p/multipath-tcp/downloads/detail?name=mptcp-sample.tcl&can=2&q=#makechanges

  The sample script create 2 mptcp instances (sender and receiver) and 2 pairs of SackFullTcpAgent. In the configuration in the sample script, all connections should get almost the same amount of bandwidth after they reach equivalent state. 

= How to parse mptcp traffic from trace file =

  If you put the following line in your scripts, the trace module outputs mptcp information in trace files.
   % *Trace set show_tcphdr_ 2* _
 
  The mptcp traffic in trace files will be something like:

   *- 0.130126 1 10 tcp 576 ------- 0 1.1 4.1 537 22 1 0x18 40 0 D 1073 537 536*




= Write your own scripts =
